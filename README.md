# Creating our own printf function

## Description
---
This repository contains all the prototypes and code lines to create the function _printf a variant of printf

The goal of this project is to learn:
- How to work in group
- How to use github in group (branch)
- Learn the function write and how to use it
- Use knowledge about malloc free
- Use knowledge about va_start, va_end, va_copy, va_arg
- Use knowledge about loops, algorithmy
- how to create a flowchart

The project is by group of 2, i'm with Kedia Ihogoza.

This is our **flowchart** to show us the solution we will do.
## Flowchart

![Flowchart_printf](./images/flowchart%20_printf%20holberton.svg)

# Requirements
---
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- n the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation; do not push your own main.c file. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Tech Stack
---
- **C language**

## Man page
---
command (on ubuntu): man ./man_3_printf.3

## File Description
--- 
|File|Description|
|----|-----------|
|main.h|Is the header contains prototypes and library|
|README.md|The README file you are currently reading|
|_printf.c|Is the file of main function _printf|
|_putchar.c| Is the file of the function _putchar necessary for _printf|
|man_3_printf.3| Is the man page of _printf|
